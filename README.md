# 👋 Hi, I'm Divya Shankar  
**Data Scientist | Generative AI | RAG | AI Agents | ML Engineering | Software Engineering**

I'm a Data Scientist with 3+ years of experience in design and development of AI/ML pipelines, statistical analysis, quantitative analysis, and large data analysis. My work has reduced semiconductor manufacturing defects by **25%**, accelerated wafer attribute processing time by **95%**, and enabled **$2M+** in business savings.

I am currently upskilling in **Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Vector Databases, LLM Tool Use, and AI Agent Development** to stay aligned with the rapidly evolving AI landscape and 2025 Data Science job market.

# 🚀 What I'm Working On (2025)
I am following a structured, 12-week roadmap focused on:

### **🔹 Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- Transformer foundations  
- Embeddings  
- Fine-tuning vs prompting  

### **🔹 Prompt Engineering**
- CoT prompting  
- ReAct / tool-use prompting  
- Output schema design  
- Evaluation & safety  

### **🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Chunking strategies  
- Vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)  
- Hybrid search (BM25 + semantic)  
- RAG evaluation (RAGAS)  
- Agentic RAG  

### **🔹 AI Agents**
- Tool-calling (SQL, Python, APIs)  
- Multi-agent orchestration  
- Workflow graphs (LangGraph)  
- Memory, planning & reasoning

# 🌱 Career Break: What I Focused On  
At the end of 2022 (November), I took a planned break due to personal reasons and this time has allowed me to reflect on what I want next in my career as well as deepen my technical skills to align with the rapidly changing job market needs.  

During this period I:  
- Completed multiple freelance data science projects  
- Upskilled through hands-on GenAI, NLP, and ML work  
- Planned a structured return to the industry with a focus on Generative AI and modern DS skills
